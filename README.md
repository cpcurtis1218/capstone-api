# Expense Tracker

Also view the frontend repo [here](https://github.com/cpcurtis1218/capstone-client).

## Technologies Used
In creating this API I used Ruby on Rails and the deployed app is hosted on Heroku.

## Planning and Execution
When first planning my application I created the wireframe and about a dozen user stories.  Once I felt comfortable with my planning, I built the API.  Once the API was completed I worked on the front-end functionality.  Once I was satisfied with the behaviors of the front-end I completed the styling.


## Current Issues
There is currently no way for the user to sort their expenses.


## Future Additions
I would like to add a search option and a sort option which would provide the user
with more ways to view their expense information.
